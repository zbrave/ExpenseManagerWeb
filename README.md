[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zbrave/ExpenseManagerWeb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zbrave/ExpenseManagerWeb)

Expense Manager Web App. is a Web App. of Expense Manager Desktop version :)
In this project, I want to approach a little different architecture. Like todays new app., this app. powered by RESTFul API.
Backend of the application supported by Spring. At the moment, accesses are secured with basic authentication.
# Techs:
  - RESTFul API
  - Spring
  - Angular JS
  - MySQL
